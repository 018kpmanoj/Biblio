“To ask why we need libraries at all, when there is so much information available elsewhere, is about as sensible as asking if roadmaps are necessary now that there are so very many roads.”

The main purpose of our project is to automate the day-to-day working of a library. It is used to make the efficient use of the human resources in addition to the computing power.

The administrator can
    • Issue books to a user
    • Return books from a user
    • Create a new user account
    • Maintain the book database – add, delete, update
    • Search for any book

The user can also access his/her account. He/she is provided with the following features
    • Search books
    • Issue books
    • Return books
    • Reserve books if currently unavailable
    • Cancel reservations
    • Check the status of the books they currently have borrowed

Whenever a new user is registered, an email is sent to the provided email ID with the login credentials. The user can then use them to access his account, and avail the benefits of the library.
